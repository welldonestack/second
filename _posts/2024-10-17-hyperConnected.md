#### The typography reflects evolving connections between people influenced by augmented reality, symbolized by interconnected veins. Speech bubbles in negative space are as important as the words, seamlessly integrating elements in hyper-connected contexts. Teal type nods to nostalgic DOS aesthetics, while an orange background emphasizes technological advancements leading to a better future. The design was one of the three Trans-Tasman winners of the 2024 BJ Ball/Ball & Doggett GSM Student Design Contest, chosen from nine outstanding local finalists. It showcased exceptional talent from both New Zealand and Australia. The Judges commented 'I enjoyed the graphic approach of this image and it’s something that I would be happy looking at for a month.'
