#### A contemporary identity system was designed, blending traditional Italian motifs with modern craftsmanship cues to create a visual language that balances authenticity and modernity. The color palette draws inspiration from classic gelato flavors: chocolate, vanilla, macadamia nut, and pistachio. The font Montecatini, chosen for its Italian heritage, adds a refined and timeless touch to the brand. A curved line motif, inspired by the original story of a cow jumping over the moon, reflects the Art Deco style and pays homage to Enmore’s iconic architectural heritage, where the gelateria originated. The motion design incorporates the cow and the moon story, where the cow makes several attempts to jump over the moon and finally succeeds—achieving what was once considered impossible.
