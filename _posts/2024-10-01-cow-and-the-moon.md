#### Designed a contemporary identity system that seamlessly blends traditional Italian motifs with modern craftsmanship cues, creating a visual language that honors authenticity while embracing contemporary design sensibilities. The color palette takes inspiration from classic gelato flavors: chocolate, vanilla, macadamia nut, and pistachio. The font Montecatini was chosen for its Italian heritage, adding a refined and timeless feel to the brand. The curved line motif, inspired by the brand's original story of a cow jumping over the moon, also reflects the Art Deco style, celebrating Enmore's iconic architectural heritage, where the gelateria was born.
