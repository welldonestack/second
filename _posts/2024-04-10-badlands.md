#### Drawing inspiration from police crime scene tape, I designed a composition that balances structured order with calculated disorder. While the film descriptions follow a strict grid layout, the central sequences appear hastily taped at angles, adding dynamic tension. The film stills are fragmented in a cubist style, creating an unsettling effect that reflects our perception of unusual sights. This not only addresses space constraints but also captures each film's mysterious essence, enhancing audience intrigue and anticipation.
