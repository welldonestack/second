#### Faced with the challenge of balancing limited space and maintaining visual impact, I developed a dynamic layout system inspired by crime scene tape. By combining structured grids with intentionally tilted imagery, I introduced a sense of controlled chaos that preserved each film's unique atmosphere while weaving a cohesive visual narrative. To creatively address space constraints, I transformed images into a cubist style using a custom tool and bitmapped them with a duotone color palette. This approach not only captured the classic essence of the films but reimagined them in a modern context, creating a distinctive aesthetic that seamlessly extended across brochures, tickets, and motion graphics—captivating and intriguing the audience.

↳ The concept of tickets resembling cookie boxes gives you the feeling of holding something good in your hand, ready to be experienced. It's akin to the moment when your tickets are collected and the performance is about to start.
