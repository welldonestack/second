#### Maroon 5 creates music for everyone—easy listening and catchy songs. In this regard, the album concept should be straightforward and memorable. “Baked” is a word with many layers of meaning, but most of all, it evokes a sense of smell, warm passion, and goodness. Embracing the cookie concept, the soft, round, yet chunky font "Podium Soft Regular" was chosen, along with a colorful yet neutral palette. The whole package share the core story but transforms according to the medium.
