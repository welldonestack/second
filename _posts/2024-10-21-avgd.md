 "Challenge: Design a visual identity for a niche second-hand store specializing in military classic apparel, positioning the brand as offering curated, clean vintage pieces in contrast to the surplus 'unready-to-wear' selections of typical vintage shops. The identity should appeal to well-groomed men in their 30s and 40s seeking a refined, boutique-style shopping experience."

#### The design solution addresses the challenges by incorporating a rounded rectangular shape inspired by a dog tag, subtly referencing the store’s focus on military classic apparel. This shape was then broken into a grid, creating a modern camouflage pattern, which shifts when combined with the background. This visual interplay mirrors how classic, well-curated pieces can take on a new character when paired with different items. True to the brand’s avant-garde name, this unique concept leaves a lasting impression, perfectly aligned with the boutique-style experience the brand seeks to offer.
