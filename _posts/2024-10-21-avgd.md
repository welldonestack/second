 "Challenge: Design a visual identity for a niche second-hand store specializing in military classic apparel, positioning the brand as offering curated, clean vintage pieces in contrast to the surplus 'unready-to-wear' selections of typical vintage shops. The identity should appeal to well-groomed men in their 30s and 40s seeking a refined, boutique-style shopping experience."

#### The design solution draws on the strategic origins of military camouflage - the art of concealment and revelation. The AVGD logotype, set in a dog tag-inspired rounded rectangle, demonstrates this through its motion: initially concealed in the dark background, it gradually reveals itself as an animated light sheen passes behind it. This shape breaks into a modern grid pattern that shifts against the backdrop, symbolizing how vintage military pieces can be transformed in contemporary contexts. This interplay between hidden and visible elements reflects the brand's curated approach to military classics, setting it apart from typical surplus retailers.
