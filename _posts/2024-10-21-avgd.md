 "Challenge: Design a visual identity for a niche second-hand store specializing in military classic apparel, positioning the brand as offering curated, clean vintage pieces in contrast to the surplus 'unready-to-wear' selections of typical vintage shops. The identity should appeal to well-groomed men in their 30s and 40s seeking a refined, boutique-style shopping experience."

Set in a dog tag-inspired shape and broken into shifting grid patterns, the identity transforms military classics into contemporary design, echoing the brand's refined approach to vintage curation.
